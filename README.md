This repository contains an example of my Power BI practice project.

You can find previews in `example_sales1.pdf` and `example_sales2.pdf`, while the full project file is available as `example_sales.pbix`.

This is my very first Power BI report, created in one afternoon.
During this project, I practiced:
* Basic data transformation – handling missing data, converting to date formats, splitting/merging columns, etc.
* Data visualization – creating simple line and bar charts.
* Report interactivity – using slicers to filter data by time period or product.

So far, I’ve enjoyed the interactivity of Power BI dashboards, and I love that it integrates with R and Python.
